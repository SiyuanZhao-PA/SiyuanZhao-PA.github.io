This study proposes an organization–person framework and examines whether management of public officials shapes capable young elites' preferences of government jobs. Using a conjoint experiment in China, we find that monetary and nonmonetary traits of governments jobs alter capable young elites' motivations to engage in public service. In particular, merit-based selection rule and high wages attract more capable young elites to serve in public services. In contrast, campaign-style corruption investigation may deter them from serving in government. Furthermore, the effects of civil service management are contingent upon individuals' attributes. Individuals with political connections are less likely to prefer merit-based selection rules and more likely care about the economic return on government jobs, but intensive corruption investigation is more likely to crowd out those with weak public service motivation.
