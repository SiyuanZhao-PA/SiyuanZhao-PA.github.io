I am **Siyuan Zhao**, a PhD student in Public Administration and Policy at the University of Georgia. Before coming to UGA, I received my BA and MA from Peking University, Beijing, China.

My research interests lie in **citizen–state interactions**, **public personnel administration**, and **comparative public management**. In previous studies, I used survey experiments to examine how public policies and administrative processes shape citizen perceptions, attitudes, and preferences. Recently, I have been focusing on the applicability and salience of core concepts in PA across different political contexts, and hope to conduct more empirical research from a cross-cultural perspective.

Currently, I also serve as a graduate teaching assistant in the School of Public and Internatioal Affairs (SPIA) at the University of Georgia. I am passionate about teaching, and enjoy connecting with peers who share a commitment to high-quality teaching.

Outside of academia, I enjoy swimming, touring around (almost aimlessly), and spending time with my family and friends.
